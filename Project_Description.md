## Project Description

### The Problem
Every day, thousands of students across Australia face safety risks on their journey to school. Traditional route planning focuses on speed and convenience, often leading students through high-traffic areas, poorly lit streets, or isolated paths. Parents lack reliable tools to assess route safety, and schools struggle to provide comprehensive safety guidance to families.

### Our Solution
Trust Track revolutionizes school route planning by putting safety first. Our application combines multiple data sources to create intelligent, safety-focused routing that considers:

- **Historical crash data** to identify high-risk areas
- **Infrastructure analysis** including lighting, sidewalks, and pedestrian facilities
- **Population density** to favor well-monitored routes
- **Real-time transport data** for live bus tracking and updates
- **Multi-modal options** including walking, public transport, and school buses

### Key Features
- **Safety-First Routing**: Every route is evaluated using comprehensive safety algorithms
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live bus tracking and dynamic route adjustments
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Seamless combination of walking, public transport, and school buses
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual route comparison with safety overlays
- **Parent Dashboard**: Comprehensive safety monitoring and alerts
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices for accessibility

## Data Story

  - Pedestrian-focused network analysis
  - Infrastructure assessment (sidewalks, lighting, crossings)
  - Safety scoring based on road classification and features
  - Route optimization using graph algorithms

### Data Innovation
Our key innovation lies in **cross-dataset correlation** and **safety-focused transformation**:

1. **Spatial Integration**: We combine crash data with transport networks to identify dangerous intersections and road segments
2. **Temporal Analysis**: We analyze crash patterns by time to provide time-sensitive route recommendations
3. **Infrastructure Assessment**: We correlate road features with safety outcomes to create predictive safety models
4. **Multi-Modal Optimization**: We integrate walking, bus, and school transport data for comprehensive journey planning

### Impact and Outcomes
Through our data transformation, we've created:
- **52 crash points** analyzed across 7 years of data
- **4 major road segments** with detailed safety assessments
- **Comprehensive safety scoring** algorithms for route optimization
- **Real-time integration** capabilities for live safety updates
