# Trust Track - School Safety Demo

A comprehensive school safety routing application designed to help parents and students find the safest routes to school using public transport, school buses, and walking paths with real-time safety analysis.

## What is Trust Track?

Trust Track is a modern web application that prioritizes student safety when planning routes to school. It combines real-time public transport data, school bus services, safety analytics, and interactive mapping to provide parents with peace of mind and students with secure travel options.

### Mission
Making school journeys safer, one route at a time by providing data-driven safety analysis and intelligent route planning.

## Key Features

### Safety-First Routing
- **Safety Scoring**: Every route is evaluated for safety factors including crash history, road conditions, and pedestrian infrastructure
- **Well-lit Paths**: Prioritizes routes with good lighting and visibility
- **Population Density**: Favors populated, well-monitored areas
- **Traffic Patterns**: Considers pedestrian-friendly routes and low-traffic streets

### Multi-Modal Transport
- **Public Transport**: Integration with Canberra's public transport network
- **School Buses**: Dedicated school bus services and routes
- **Walking Routes**: Safe pedestrian paths with safety overlays
- **Park & Ride**: Convenient parking and transport options

### Real-Time Features
- **Live Bus Tracking**: Real-time bus location and arrival predictions
- **Dynamic Route Updates**: Automatic re-routing for safety incidents
- **Safety Alerts**: Immediate notifications for route changes
- **Interactive Maps**: Real-time route visualization with safety overlays

### Modern User Interface

### Data Sources
- **ACT Government**: School census, transport, and safety data
- **OpenStreetMap**: Road network and infrastructure data
- **ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics)**: Demographic and transport statistics

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection & Analysis
The system starts with comprehensive data analysis:
- **Crash Data**: Historical crash records from 2015-2021
- **Transport Data**: Bus routes, school bus services, and schedules
- **Infrastructure**: Road networks, sidewalks, and lighting data
- **Demographics**: School locations and population density

### 2. Safety Scoring Algorithm
Each route is evaluated using multiple safety factors:
- **Crash Density**: Historical crash frequency per road segment
- **Road Classification**: Risk scores based on road type and traffic
- **Pedestrian Infrastructure**: Sidewalk availability and quality
- **Lighting Assessment**: Street lighting coverage and quality
- **Population Density**: Well-monitored vs. isolated areas

### 3. Route Optimization
The system uses advanced algorithms to find optimal routes:
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance safety vs. time
- **Graph-based Routing**: Network analysis for path finding
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust preferences based on user settings
- **Alternative Generation**: Provide multiple route options

### 4. Real-Time Integration
Live data keeps routes current and safe:
- **Bus Tracking**: Real-time location and arrival predictions
- **Incident Updates**: Safety alerts and route adjustments
- **Weather Integration**: Route modifications for weather conditions
- **Traffic Updates**: Dynamic re-routing based on current conditions
